### Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2024**, an annual coding challenge featuring daily puzzles throughout December. Each day presents two new programming problems designed to test algorithmic problem-solving and programming skills.

**Day 1: Historian Hysteria**  
The challenge involves reconciling two lists of historically significant location IDs by pairing numbers from the lists and calculating the total distance between them.

**Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports**  
The engineers are determining which reactor safety reports are safe based on specific rules: levels must either be consistently increasing or decreasing, and adjacent levels must differ by at least 1 and at most 3. In Part 2, a "Problem Dampener" is introduced, allowing a single bad level to be ignored to qualify an otherwise unsafe report as safe.

Feel free to explore the solutions, suggest improvements, or share your own approaches!
